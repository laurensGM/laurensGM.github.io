                  About Chessminds
                </h4>
               
                <p>
                  After having moved to New Zealand, Laurens rediscovered an old passion: chess. Laurens played numerous tournaments as a kid in Belgium and participated in 2 world championships. 
                  He stopped playing abruptly at the age of 12 and only picked it up again in 2017. 
                  Laurens felt there were so many elements in the game of chess that are beneficial for young children's development that he decided to teach the game. 
                  He embarked on a transformative journey into the realm of chess coaching and education. 
                  What began as an endeavor to teach a colleague's child chess evolved into the establishment and management of a flourishing private and group chess coaching business.

                <p>
                  The image below features the Chess Minds logo accompanied by its guiding slogan. 
                  Chess Minds' mission revolves around inspiring students to challenge the status quo and embrace a mindset of continuous learning and improvement. 
                  The impactful slogan, 'Make your move,' serves as a call to action, urging students to translate thought into action. 
                  This phrase embodies the idea that every chess position necessitates a move, fostering a culture where students learn to make better decisions over time.

                  </figure>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The scope of impact extended far beyond individual coaching sessions, as he took on the responsibility of promoting and coaching chess in more than 40 schools across New Zealand. 
                  This initiative not only facilitated the spread of chess as an enriching activity but also served as a testament to my commitment to fostering intellectual growth and strategic thinking in young minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A pivotal aspect of this case study is the establishment of the Rotorua Roaring Knights, a chess club founded from scratch. 
                  Serving as a volunteer coach, Laurens dedicated time and effort to nurture a community of chess enthusiasts, contributing to the local chess landscape. 
                  Additionally, Laurens extended his coaching services to Oranga Tamariki, embodying a commitment to social responsibility and providing access to the benefits of chess education to a broader audience.
                  
                  
The image below captures a coaching session led by Laurens for a group of students in Bethlehem, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. 
Laurens' coaching approach is characterized by interactivity and engagement, ensuring active participation from all students. 
The emphasis is placed on fostering a deep understanding of the underlying principles of the lesson, creating an enriching and interactive learning experience.

                  </figure>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Innovation took center stage with the development and launch of the chessminds.co website, a platform built by Laurens and designed to inspire, educate, and engage chess enthusiasts. 
                  This digital hub served as a repository for my own chess program, coaching content, and teaching programs. 
                  Notably, an innovative teaching method leveraging audio and visualization techniques was incorporated, enhancing the learning experience and making chess education more accessible and enjoyable.

                  Outcomes
                </h4>
                
                  <p>
                    The main outcomes of my entrepreneurial journey at Chess Minds are:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Sales converions rates: 89% success rate after delivery of chess open day. 
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Inspired Oranga Tamariki children with a troubled background to focus on something meaningful and getting their life back on track. 
                  
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Developed and implemented my own unique and innovative coaching methodology. 

                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Founded Rotorua Roaring Knights chess club offering weekly free coaching sessions as a volunteer.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Run coaching sessions in more than 40 schools in the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions in New Zealand.

                      </li>
                      <li>

                    The coaching sessions had a positive effect on my own chess playing performance as well. 
                    In 2019, I won the prize for fastest improving chess player in New Zealand and saw my rating grow to above 2000 elo. 

                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                
                    
                    
                    
                
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Conclusion
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    In summary, this case study encapsulates a unique blend of entrepreneurial spirit, community engagement, and educational innovation. 
                    From grassroots initiatives like founding the Rotorua Roaring Knights to the strategic launch of Chess Minds' digital presence, 
                    this endeavor showcases my versatility as a Product and General Manager, transcending traditional roles to impact and inspire through the timeless game of chess.
