Product Management Portfolio of Laurens Goormachtigh.
This portfolio was created with the help of the instructions in the Coursera project Create Your UI/UX Portfolio with GitHub.
I used the bootstrap template called 'devfolio' which can be found here: https://bootstrapmade.com/
I removed the blog section from the template.
